# kinjamprove
View any Kinja comments sections with threaded replies & other improvements at the click of a button. Never click "Show More" again!
Adds a 'Kinjamprove!' button to the top of every Kinja comments section. This button:

-Makes discussions easier to follow (i.e. read) by visually grouping messages with their replies, as well as nesting (i.e. indenting) those replies to further clarify which comment a reply is responding to. This is similar to Reddit's and Disqus's comments systems.

  -Takes you to the 'All Comments' display, saving you from having to click both 'Pending' buttons in order to see pending replies.

  -Clicks every 'Show More Comments' button so that all replies in each thread are immediately displayed.

  -Does away with the 'Hide Replies' button from the bottom of each expanded thread. This is replaced with a 'Collapse Thread' button that's added to the top of each comment. This button, when clicked, will hide all of a comment's replies. (Clicking it again will then unhide those replies.)

  -'Un-grays' pending comments so that they will appear the same as approved replies, although they'll still retain their label denoting them as pending.
